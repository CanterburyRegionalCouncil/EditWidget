## Test Datasets ##
TestDatasets.zip contains and ESRI file geodatabase with several feature classes that can be used for setting up editable environments for testing purposes.  The zip file also contains the ArcMap MXD documents that have been set up with the map service settings for the layers in the file geodatabase.  Edit templates and symbology have been set up ready for publishing as a map service - all that needs to be done is to copy the datasets to an enterprise geodatabase and change the data sources of the layers to the new locations.
